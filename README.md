# Handwritten Digits Classification

This is a repository of Handwritten Digits Classification Project to the Machine Learning class at Columbia. 

Description:
The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and labels and 10,000 testing images and labels. The esting datset is collected from the class containing about 500 images and labels. The goal is to predict the labels of the classâ€™s aggregated Handwritten Digit Data Set.

Metric:
Two elements demonstrating the result of my test: the Confusion Matrix of the predicted vs true labels and the accuracy of predicting labels, as a percentage. Higher the accuracy, better the model.

Methods:
I have implemented 5 models, including KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Convolutional Neural Network.
